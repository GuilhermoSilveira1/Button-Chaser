This project is an improvement based on a project seen during a javascript course, on linkedIn Learning. The idea was to better some JS concepts,
such as functions, loops, and so on. 

My adition to this project, was to add a "Start new game?" button, utilizing DOM manipulation, and also adding a function to restart the count. Also, a line, "Game over!" was added when the game ended, and removed when started or restarted.

I learned a lot with this project, about manipulating the DOM, writing functions, and events.
I used only HTML, CSS and JS to make this come live.
