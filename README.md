# Button Chaser

This project is an enhancement based on a JavaScript project I encountered during a LinkedIn Learning course. The idea was to reinforce JavaScript concepts such as functions, loops, and event handling.

My additions to the project include a "Start New Game?" button, using DOM manipulation, and a function to reset the game count. I also added a "Game Over!" message that appears when the game ends and disappears when the game restarts.

I learned a lot from this project about DOM manipulation, writing functions, and handling events. The project was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
